<h1>RockBands - BackEnd</h1>
<h2>  RockBands is a comprehensive website designed for rock music enthusiasts. It was created using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS and features detailed information about popular rock bands, including their history, albums, and videos. The website also includes a secure authentication system built using Firebase for user login and signup.
    To efficiently manage and retrieve relevant data, an Express backend with a MySQL database was developed. The backend contains four routes: admins, likes, bands, and feedbacks, which provide access to critical data such as admin credentials, like statistics, band information, and user feedback. This backend enables efficient data management and enhances the website's functionality.
    With its intuitive user interface, informative content, and efficient backend system, RockBands is an excellent resource for rock music enthusiasts, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience for all its users.
